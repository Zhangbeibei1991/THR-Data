-461383938	In response to mitogenic stimulation , the KSR and MEK complex is recruited from the cytosol to the cell membrane , where it can now interact with activated Raf-1 and ERK to facilitate the signal flux through the kinase module Raf -- > MEK -- > ERK .	[complex | Binding]	[interact | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
-1248639612	Yang et al. also implicated a role for ERK in the regulation of FOXO3a by Mdm2 and provide evidence that FOXO3a phosphorylation by ERK through an unknown mechanism induces Mdm2 binding to FOXO3a     .	[phosphorylation | Positive_regulation]	[binding | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
1754405446	In this complex , DNA bound REST interacts with Sin3 and CoREST , each of which bind HDAC1 and HDAC2 to repress transcription .	[interacts | Binding]	[bind | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
651279506	In Drosophila , SMRTER interacts with the beta-propeller protein Ebi and TBL1 , which binds to HDAC3 and deacetylates histones associated with Snail target genes , leading to their transcriptional repression in the embryonic mesoderm .	[interacts | Binding]	[binds | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
2013035933	The human papilloma oncoprotein E7 directly interacts with PML and blocks PML mediated cellular senescence .	[interacts | Binding]	[blocks | Negative_activation]	E1 precedes E2
732344550	E2F is a transcription factor that targets the cyclin E gene and upregulates it .  The cyclin E gene product binds to CDK2 and forms the cyclinE-CDK2 holoenzyme , which then completes the phosphorylation and inactivation of RB .	[upregulates | Positive_activation]	[binds | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
1440777018	The p53 pathway is generally activated by DNA damage , which results in phosphorylation of p53 by ATM or CHK2 at sites near MDM2 and MDM4 binding .  MDM2 or MDM4 are released , and the CKI p21 then binds to p53 .	[results | Positive_regulation]	[binds | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
-840996049	The p53 pathway is generally activated by DNA damage , which results in phosphorylation of p53 by ATM or CHK2 at sites near MDM2 and MDM4 binding .  MDM2 or MDM4 are released , and the CKI p21 then binds to p53 .	[activated | Positive_activation]	[binds | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
-1186598706	When stable ( most often as a result of phosphorylation via ATM kinase ) , p53 acts to up-regulate p21 , which then binds to the cyclinE and CDK2 complex          .	[up-regulate | Positive_regulation]	[binds | Binding]	E1 precedes E2
-16806472	When eIF4E is bound to 4E-BP1 it is prevented from joining the translation initiation complex but upon phosphorylation by mTOR , 4E-BP1 releases eIF4E which is then phosphorylated by p70S6K and can join the active initiation complex   .	[bound | Binding]	[phosphorylated | Positive_regulation]	E1 precedes E2
32070322	When eIF4E is bound to 4E-BP1 it is prevented from joining the translation initiation complex but upon phosphorylation by mTOR , 4E-BP1 releases eIF4E which is then phosphorylated by p70S6K and can join the active initiation complex   .	[bound | Binding]	[releases | Positive_regulation]	E1 precedes E2
-853367304	eEF2 is phosphorylated and inactivated by eEF2 kinase ( eEF2K ) which is , in turn , phosphorylated and inactivated by p70S6K as a result of mTOR activity         .	[phosphorylated | Positive_regulation]	[inactivated | Negative_regulation]	E2 precedes E1
